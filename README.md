## Description/Concept
For this project I made a matching app for gamers. They can choose a game that they like and then filter on ranked or causal and different modes in that game.

## Installing
1. Clone the repository with: `git clone https://github.com/Daan-Zwarthoed/Blok-Tech-Daan-Zwarthoed.git`
2. When you have done that use `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Then use `npm build` to start and open a localhost
4. Then use `npm startSass` to start the scss to css watcher
5. Now you have set up a localhost and you are free to edit the code to your liking!
